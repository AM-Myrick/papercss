I got tired of mODerN STylEs and clean pages on the internet. I also wanted to
learn more about Flexbox and Less. So I made PaperCSS to solve these two
challenges of mine :)

The goal of PaperCSS is to be as minimal as possible when adding classes. For
example, a button should just look like a paper button. There shouldn't be a
need to add a class such as `paper-button`. Because of this, adding PaperCSS to
a markdown generated page should instantly paper-ize it.

While I'm proud of how it's turned out so far, I think there's a lot that can
still be done to make it better. Such things as refactoring, adding more utility
classes and more border types (like dashed/dotted) could really polish off this
framework. That's why it's open sourced and available for pull requests!

If you are new to Git or Less, this would be a great project to get your feet
wet with. I'd be happy to help walk you through the pull request process. Check
out the Git repo for more info!
